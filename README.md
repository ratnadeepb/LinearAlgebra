# LinearAlgebra
Linear Algebra Code in Python

This is simply a translation of my understanding of Linear Algebra into code. It will not be perfect and it will not be numerically stable. Please use Numpy and Scipy for that.

This repo is just a reference as to what things may look like in code.

Note: This is a work in progress so beware of code that doesn't work or will change.
